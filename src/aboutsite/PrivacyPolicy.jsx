      <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
      <p>
        We may collect information you voluntarily provide when you contact us, register for a
        newsletter, or otherwise interact with forms on the Site. This may include: name, email
        address, and any message or files you submit to our support team.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>

      <h3>1.3 Files You Process</h3>
      <p>
        The primary purpose of OwnYourPDF is to process documents (e.g., merge, split,
        convert). Files you upload for processing are transmitted to our servers and processed
        temporarily. We do not use the content of your files for marketing or analytics. See

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the Site and its features.</li>
        <li>To process and return converted files and to provide support.</li>
        <li>To analyze usage and improve the Site (performance, reliability, UX).</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We may use third-party services that collect, process or store data on our behalf, such
        as hosting providers, analytics, crash reporting, and advertising networks (including
        Google AdSense). These third parties have their own privacy policies and we recommend
        reviewing them to understand how they handle data.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to provide essential functionality,
        measure performance, and deliver personalized advertising where permitted. You can
        control cookies via your browser settings. Disabling certain cookies may affect how the
        Site functions.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        OwnYourPDF may display ads delivered by third-party ad networks such as Google
        AdSense. These networks may use cookies and other identifiers to serve interest-based
        ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising through Google's Ads Settings and
        other industry opt-out mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>6. File Retention & Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        Uploaded files are retained only as long as necessary to complete the requested
        processing and for a short time afterward for debugging or user support (typically a few
        hours to a maximum of 30 days â€” adjust according to your infrastructure). If you want a
        file removed immediately, contact us at the address below and we will attempt to
        delete it from our servers promptly.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards intended to
        protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely
        secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such
        information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove it.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict
        processing of your personal data. Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the

        providers located in other countries. When we do so we take steps to ensure appropriate
        safeguards are in place as required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes we
